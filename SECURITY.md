## 🛡️ **Supported Versions**

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take the security of CrawlDock seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### **Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to crawldock@gmail.com.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

### **Required Information**

1. **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
3. **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
4. **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
5. **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
7. **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### **Preferred Languages**

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

### **API Key Protection**

1. **Never commit API keys to the repository**
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

2. **Restrict API key usage**
   - Set up API restrictions in Google Cloud Console
   - Limit to specific IP addresses if possible
   - Use application restrictions

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Change API keys periodically
   - Monitor for unusual usage patterns
   - Have backup keys ready

### **Environment Security**

1. **Secure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Good: Use environment variables
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   
   # Bad: Hardcode in source
   const apiKey = "your_key_here";
   ```

2. **Validate configuration**
   - Check for required environment variables
   - Validate API key format
   - Test API key functionality

### **Input Validation**

1. **Sanitize search queries**
   - Validate input length
   - Check for malicious patterns
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Rate limiting**
   - Implement per-user rate limits
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Log suspicious activity

### **Error Handling**

1. **Don't expose sensitive information**
   - Don't log API keys
   - Don't expose internal paths
   - Use generic error messages

2. **Secure logging**
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Rotate log files
